Hiversa is a unique ecosystem and one of the foremost platforms of equal opportunities for career growth, launching innovative business ideas and offering academic research grants and scholarships.

#### __Tech Stack__
  React Native, Python(Django), Postgres, Heroku.

#### __Architectural Pattern__
  Hiversa's backend was designed with a Monolithics approach using Python(Django and Postgres).
And Hiversa mobile application was developed with react-native and Redux.
#### __Design Patterns__
  Our design patterns are based on two main principles of object-oriented design:
- Develop to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor object composition over inheritance.
#### __Contributions__ 

+ I single-handedly developed Hiversa mobile application using react-native, redux,  and redux-thunk

+ Used Jest and react-test-library for Unit testing of all the modules of the mobile application.

+ I  worked as a part of a team of 3 engineers to develop the Hiversa web application using reactjs, redux, and redux-thunk.
