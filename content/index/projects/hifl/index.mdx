#### __Tech Stack__
  React, NextJs, Typescript, NodeJS, Javascript, AWS(Lambda, DynamoDB, API gateway, VPS, DynamoDB Stream, SNS, SQS).

#### __Architectural Pattern__
  HIFL web-backend was designed with a micro-service and serverless orchestration approach with the highest level of abstraction of the system design. Furthermore, when building the architectural pattern of the system we focus on layers and modules and how they are communicating with each other using rest API.
#### __Design Patterns__
  Our design patterns are based on two main principles of object-oriented design:
- Develop to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor object composition over inheritance.
#### __Contributions__ 

+ I am part of a team of 2 engineers that built the back-end application of HIFL, designed on the ideas of cloud-native micro-service architecture and modern serverless Cloud computing service, using orchestration and test-driven approach and dynamo DB stream as an event source. 

+ Architect HIFL core web backend with microservices architecture using Nodejs/Typescript, AWS, DynamoDB stream,

+ Worked on various company in-house HRM and DMS application built on Python, PostgreSQL, Nextjs, Reactjs, Firestore, and AWS.

+ Developed RU mobile application using React Native.

+ Used jest for Unit testing of all the modules of this framework covering various test cases.

+ Worked on the application documentation.
