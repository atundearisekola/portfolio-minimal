Simplifying modern commerce by helping solopreneurs and small businesses grow into an all-inclusive banking service that works.
#### __Tech Stack__
  AWS(Lambda, DynamoDB, API gateway, VPS, DynamoDB Stream, SNS, SQS), React, Haxe, Typescript, NodeJS, Javascript. 

#### __Architectural Pattern__
  Payrail web-backend was designed with a micro-service and serverless event-driven approach with the highest level of abstraction of the system design. Furthermore, when building the architectural pattern of the system we focus on layers and modules and how they are communicating with each other.
#### __Design Patterns__
  Our design patterns are based on two main principles of object-oriented design:
- Develop to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor object composition over inheritance.
#### __Contributions__ 
+ I am part of a team of 3 engineers that built the back-end application of Payrail business, designed on the ideas of cloud-native micro-service architecture and modern serverless Cloud computing service, following an event-driven and test-driven approach. 

+ Single-handedly developed SDK for other system platforms using   Haxe "Haxe is an open-source high-level cross-platform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code, for many different computing platforms from one code-base."  for multiple language compiler.

+ Used Mocha and Chai for Unit testing of all the modules of this framework covering various test cases.

+ Worked on the application documentation
