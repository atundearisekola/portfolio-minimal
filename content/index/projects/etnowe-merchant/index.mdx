ETNOWE is a revolutionary and innovative marketplace for African and Caribbean grocery stores in the U.S., facilitating seamless shopping, quick delivery, and rapid pickup. Our primary focus is to bridge the socio-economic gap by providing delivery capabilities for all the ethnic grocery stores located in the U.S.

#### Software Product I Worked On.
  Etnowe Customer, Etnowe Merchant..
#### __Tech Stack__
  React Native, Python, Postgres, AWS(Kinesis, Chalice, Lambda,  API gateway, VPS, SNS, SQS, cognitor, amplify).

#### __Architectural Pattern__
  Etnowe Customer web-backend was designed with a micro-service and serverless event-driven approach.
And Etnowe mobile application was developed with react-native and context-hook.
 With the highest level of abstraction of the system design, when building the architectural pattern of the system we focus on layers and modules and how they are communicating with each other.
#### __Design Patterns__
  Our design patterns are based on two main principles of object-oriented design:
- Develop to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor object composition over inheritance.
#### __Contributions__ 
+ I work as a full-stack with other engineers to develop the backend of Etnowe with Python(Chalice)

+ I was also part of the team of 3 engineers that develop Etnowe mobile front-end the react-native and expo

+ Used Jest and react-test-library for Unit testing of all the modules of the mobile application.
