#### __Tech Stack__
  Reactjs, Python(Django), Postgres, Heroku.

#### __Architectural Pattern__
  AgencyOS backend was designed with a Monolithics approach using Python(Django and Postgres).
  And the web front-end application was developed with reactjs, redux-thunk, and Redux.
#### __Design Patterns__
  Our design patterns are based on two main principles of object-oriented design:
- Develop to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor object composition over inheritance.
#### __Contributions__ 
+ I  worked as a part of a team of 3 engineers to develop the Hiversa web application using reactjs, redux, and redux-thunk.

+ Worked on various company in-house HRM and DMS application built on Python, PostgreSQL, Nextjs, Reactjs, Firestore, and AWS.
