import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a full-stack engineer with a passion for building meaningful products, I have more than 5 years of experience in application development, and technical expertise in various architectural styles/patterns and objects oriented design patterns. I have successfully developed, and supported live use applications with micro-service and server-less with event driven architecture approach.

Most of my positions utilized agile-like development process using Jira or Trello.

A day in my life may consist of: designing front-end of an application, development of REST API, configuring a unit or ui test library, setting up a build or deployment plan, provisioning a test tier or production cloud native services, database design, dockerizing an application. 

##### One fact (outside of work) about me...
I'm also into Geospatial and information systems. I also have professional experience in working with geospatial tools like ArcGIS and QGIS for both government and private entities, and any chance I get to talk GIS is a moment that I revel in!"
